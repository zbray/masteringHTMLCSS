family)

line-height
This changes the height of each line in a block of text. This changes the amount of vertical space each line of text gets.


#### text-transform
The `text-transform` property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.

The below values and their effect on the text "Transform me"

`inherit` => uses the value from the parent element
`none` => Default: uses the original text


### Shapes and Shading

The `box-shadow` property creates a rectangular shadow behind an element's entire box
