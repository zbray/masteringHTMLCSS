# General Topics

## Comments
Comments are lines of text that we write when we want to leave notes for ourselves and other developers. This is a great way to help other developers understand your code better by annotating bits of code,  breaking out files into sections, or adding meta information to code files. This text has no effect on the output of your code because, when placed in the right syntax, the coding language you're writing in will know to ignore it.

### Javascript Comment Syntax

In JavaScript we add comments in two ways, one for single-line comments and one for multi-line comments, or "blocks."

**Single-line** comments are triggered by two forward slashes

```// Single-line comment```

**Blocks** also known as **multi-line comments** start with ```/*``` and end with ```*/``` . JavaScript will ignore everything between these opening and closing tags. This is also the same syntax used for all CSS comments, regardless of the number of lines used.
